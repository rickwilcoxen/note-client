# Note Application
Project prompt/idea: create a mental health resource app that allows users to save information like doctor's phone numbers or med info.

## Planning Story
Other similar apps are usually only available on phones and aren't necessarily helpful for people who have vision impairments or problems using tiny screens.

Doctor's numbers can get lost in papers or other notes on phones, and med information can sometimes be difficult to remember for people with memory issues. This app is meant to be a place where users can save necessary information in a single place.

### User Stories

- As a first time user I would like to be able to sign up and log in.
- As a returning user, I would like to be able to log in, change my password, and log out.
- As a returning user I would like to be able to have one source for where I save important information regarding my health including phone numbers, prescription information, and more in the form of a note.
- As a returning user, I would like to be able to view all my notes in one place so I can see everything I've created in one place.
- As a returning user, I would like to be able to edit and delete my notes.
- As any user, returning or new, I would like to be able to view mental health resources on one page for information regarding hotlines, other helpful apps or websites, and more.
